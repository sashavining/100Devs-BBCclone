A visual copy of the BBC homepage, made to practice HTML and CSS (no JavaScript)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

## Optimizations

I relied heavily on FlexBox for positioning in the project. Though I endorse my use of it for the navbar, it did not make sense or work very well for the body of the webpage. Next time, I would use Grid or float for the body instead.

## Lessons Learned:

I was proud of how I was able to look at the original image, split the visual into boxes, and create something that was at least visually similar to the original. This is a small thing, but I was pleased with how the "US ELECTION 2020", "US&CANADA," etc. labels came out. Making the left-border of a div thick and then padding it away from the text is a clever trick, and looks great. I'm happy to have it in my back pocket now.
